Working with remotes

Remotes repos are versions of your projects that are hosted on the internet or on some other network

Showing your remotes

To see the remotes that you have configured use 
$ git remote 
For a more verbose output we need to mention -v
$ git remote -v

Adding a remote repository 
$ git remote add <remote name> <url>

If we want to fetch all the information that the remotes repo has that we dont have
$ git fetch <remote name>

"git fetch" downloads all the added info to the local repo after cloning, but does not merge the file. 

"git pull" command does download the additional info and also merges the with the current branch.

Pushing to remotes

When we want to push the project to the remote 
$ git push <remote> <branch>

Inspecting a remote
$ git remote show <remote name>

Renaming remotes
$ git remote rename <present file name> <new file name>

Removing remotes
$ git remote remove <remote name>
