Git Branching
=============

Branching means you diverge from the main line and work on with changes without messing with the original code.

**** Git branching is a killer feature ****

To create a new branch to master
$ git branch <branch name>

To point HEAD pointer to the new branch, we need to checkout this branch.
$ git checkout <branch name>

Now all the changes made will be in this new branch and will not affect the master branch

To create a new branch and switch to it at the same time, you can run the git checkout command with the -b switch:
$ git checkout -b <branch name>

This is shorthand for:

$ git branch <branch name>
$ git checkout <branch name>

Deleting a branch (if necessary after merging the branch with master)
$ git branch -d hotfix
